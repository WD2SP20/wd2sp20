  get story(){ return `Spring vacation usually falls around Easter time. The schools are
closed and all the ${this.pluralNoun1.val} get ${this.number.val} weeks off.
The ${this.adj1.val} teachers also get a vacation. There are lots of
things to do during Easter vacation. Some kids loaf around and
watch the ${this.noun1.val}. Others get outside and play ${this.typeOfGame.val},
while more ambitious students spend their time studying
their ${this.adj2.val} books so they will grow up to become
${this.pluralNoun2.val}. Little kids also color ${this.adj3.val} eggs.
Here's how you color an egg: first, mix a package of ${this.adj4.val}
dye in a bowl full of ${this.typeofLiquid1.val}. Then, dip a(n) ${this.noun2.val}
in the bowl and rinse it off with ${this.typeofLiquid2.val}. Then, after
it dries, you can paint it with a brush. Then you show it to your
friends, who will say, "Boy what a ${this.adj5.val} egg!"`},
